- Register ports in 'Public Port 1:', 'Public Port 2:', and 'Public Port 3:', and save them because you will need them when someone wants to communicate with you.
  
- Set Public Port 1,2 and 3.

* Although the IP addresses of Wi-Fi networks have changed, a DNS service has been added to establish the domain and communicate between the sender and the recipient.
